This repository contains my solutions to different LeetCode problems. I started solving them to improve my coding and problem solving skills.

I use LeetCode to learn new techniques, explore logic from different angles, and get better at algorithms and data structures. I try to practice regularly, but I also take breaks when needed to stay consistent and focused.

Some problems take me only a few hours to solve, while others take days to fully understand and complete. Each problem helps me learn something new and think more clearly about how to approach challenges.

In 2025, I earned a badge for solving more than 50 LeetCode problems. It reminds me how much Iâ€™ve grown and encourages me to keep learning every day.
